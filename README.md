kitcard-reader
==============

Reads the KITCard RFID card and displays information such as the wallet's balance, the card number and the card's type (student, employee, etc.). It requires API version 10+ (aka 2.3.3 and up) and a device with Near Field Communication.

Cards with the same format: Campuscard of HS Karlsruhe, Chipcard of PH Karlsruhe, Chipcard of DHBW Karlsruhe and Guest cards of Studentenwerk Karlsruhe.

It has been tested with Nexus S, Galaxy S III, Galaxy Nexus, HTC One X, Motorola RAZR i (phones) and Nexus 7 (tablet). Due to technical differences it will not work on either Nexus 4 (phone) or Nexus 10 (tablet).

This project is not associated with either Karlsruhe Institute of Technology or Studentenwerk Karlsruhe.

This app is available in Google's play store. Some tested and confirmed working devices (like Motorola RAZR i) are not allowed to install this app through the store due to technical restrictions.
